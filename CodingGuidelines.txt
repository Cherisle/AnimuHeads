Coding Guidelines

1.  Curly braces should appear on their own line when they are not nested over 3 times from the beginning.
	Ex.
		public void Poo() 
		{
			Stuff;
		}
		
	Under the case that they are nested over 3 times, the deepest nested braces may have initial curly brace on the same line.
	
	Ex.
		public void Poo() 
		{
			if(stuff == null)
			{
				if(stuff2 == null)
				{
					if(stuff3 == null){   //curly brace may be on the same line at this point
						doSomething;
					}
				}
			}
		}	

2.  For all if-else condition statements, use curly braces, even if the body is only one line. No exceptions.

3.  When you add your own variables to a script, make sure to organize them and not toss them somewhere random. [Readability]
