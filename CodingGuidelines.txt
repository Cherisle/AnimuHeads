Coding Guidelines

1.  Curly braces should appear on their own line.
	Ex.
		public void Poo() 
		{
			Stuff;
		}

2.  For all if-else condition statements, use curly braces, even if the body is only one line.

3.  When you add your own variables to a script, make sure to organize them and not toss them somewhere random.
