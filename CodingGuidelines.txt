Coding Guidelines

1.  Curly braces should appear on their own line when they are not nested over 3 times from the beginning.
	Ex.
		public void Poo() 
		{
			Stuff;
		}
		
	Under the case that they are nested over 3 times, the deepest nested braces may have initial curly brace on the same line.
	
	Ex.
		public void Poo() 
		{
			if(stuff == null)
			{
				if(stuff2 == null)
				{
					if(stuff3 == null){   //curly brace may be on the same line at this point
						doSomething;
					}
				}
			}
		}	

2.  For all if-else condition statements, use curly braces, even if the body is only one line. No exceptions.

3.  When you add your own variables to a script, make sure to organize them and not toss them somewhere random. [Readability]

4.  When you decide to comment on the code, make sure you include your initials at the beginning of the comment. Comments 
    which do not include initials at the beginning are mine (MT) and are there to help you catch up on understanding the code.
    
5.  If deciding on whether a variable or method should be public or private, always make it initially private. Make it public 
    only if you expect to call it from another script.
    
6.  NEVER put Destroy(GameObject go) calls inside a loop (e.g. for loop, for each loop)
